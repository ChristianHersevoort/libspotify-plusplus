Spotify/Disc
 - be able to ask an album for the number of discs that it contains
 - be able to obtain a 'disc' object for each of them (with references to the tracks in parent album)

?? Cache raw pointers in look-up table, or associate userdata with them?
 - so that we can always return the same C++ handle for the same artist/track/album etc
   - i.e. when retrieving Album from a track, and from an ArtistBrowse 

Different behaviour on spottily objects while they are loading
 - throw exception?

Refactor IsLoading() as HasLoaded() to match libspotify

"Loaded Callbacks" where supported
