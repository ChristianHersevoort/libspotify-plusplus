ABOUT
---------------------------

C++ wrapper for the libspotify api provided by spotify.

Dependencies
- libspotify 0.0.8 (as provided by spotify)
- boost c++ libraries


TODO (unordered collection of ideas for forthcoming work)
---------------------------

Update for libspotify 9

Spotify/Disc
 - be able to ask an album for the number of discs that it contains
 - be able to obtain a 'disc' object for each of them (with references to the tracks in parent album)

?? Cache raw pointers in look-up table, or associate userdata with them?
 - so that we can always return the same C++ handle for the same artist/track/album etc
   - i.e. when retrieving Album from a track, and from an ArtistBrowse 

Different behaviour on spottily objects while they are loading
 - throw exception?

Refactor IsLoading() as HasLoaded() to match libspotify
 - perhaps refactor all functions to more closely match libspotify api

"Loaded Callbacks" where supported
